This repo explains :-:


This repository contains the code for the Affordemy application, a simple login-based application built using Kivy, a Python library for developing multitouch applications. The code includes a splash screen, a login screen, and a main screen with a menu and various buttons for navigating the application. The login screen includes input fields for email and password, as well as buttons for signing in and autofilling the input fields. The main screen includes a menu with buttons for accessing various features of the application, such as the user's profile, top courses, and payment information. The code also includes a function for handling the login button click event, which checks if the email and password input fields are filled and displays an error message if they are not. The code is written in markdown format for easy viewing and editing.
